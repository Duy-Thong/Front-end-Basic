        This is a paragraph inside a block-level <code>div</code> element.
        Block-level elements typically start on a new line and stretch to fill
        the width of their container.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's another paragraph to demonstrate the block-level behavior. Each
        paragraph occupies its own block in the layout.
